{"name":"Android-calendarservice","tagline":"A service which retrieves calendar events","body":"Calendar Service for Android\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis Calendar Service is used for retrieving calendar events in a specified time range.\r\n\r\nYou can either copy the content to your own working directory, or export them to a .JAR file.\r\n\r\nPlease do not delete the references.\r\n\r\nBasic use\r\n---\r\nFor accessing the data, simply use CalendarService.readCalendar(class.this); \r\nthis is the basic constructor which provides events for +/- 1 day time range in the calendar.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you can also simply use the context (instead of class.this) if you are, for instance, using fragments.\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can also apply specific parameters based on the following constructor:\r\n\r\nCalendarService.readCalendar(class.this, int days, int hours)\r\n\r\nAn example would look like the following:\r\n\r\nCalendarService.readCalendar(class.this, 2, 5)\r\n\r\nThis would provide you +/- 2 days and +/- 5 hours respectively.\r\n\r\nConstraints\r\n---\r\nDue to the [changes in the API in Android 4.0](http://android-developers.blogspot.dk/2011/10/ics-and-non-public-apis.html) (Ice Cream Sandwich), this service can only be utilised by using a different cursor for API 4.0+.\r\nThe cursor has been commented, but can simply be used by uncommenting the code block in the CalendarService.java class.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n---\r\nThanks to [SLEEPLisNight](https://github.com/SLEEPLisNight) for finding a solution for the API 4.0 issue.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---\r\nLicensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0] (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n---\r\nCreated by David Laundav and contributed by Christian Orthmann.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
